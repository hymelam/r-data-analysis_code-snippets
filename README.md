# Code snippets from old R data analyses
This repository is a contains some R code I've used in data analysis (univariate and multivariate meta-analyses). [[ADD BRIEF DESCRIPTION]]]

It is currently unorganized and does not (and will not) include the original dataset, in whole or in part, and cannot be run from this repository.

To-do list (as of 2/28/2019): 
1. Clean up the code (I've underwent a lot of Personal Growth regarding code commenting practices, RMarkdown use, etc., since this was written), 
2. Attempt to get a similar version running on a publicly available or simulated dataset. (The examples use ```metafor``` to conduct meta-regressions, but the example can be simplified by running traditional regression models.)
3. At the least, export and document any functions or portions of code that lend themself to use on a wider array of datasets.
